=============================
  Security Log Capture Tool
=============================

This guide explains how to use the tool, where to run it, and where the logs are stored.

------------------------------------
1. What this tool does
------------------------------------
- Detects failed login attempts on Windows.
- Takes a snapshot whenever a failed login happens.
- Collects logs and stores them in the "security_logs" folder.

------------------------------------
2. What files are included
------------------------------------
- log.ps1        → PowerShell script that runs the Python script.
- your_script.py → Python script that takes snapshots and saves logs.
- security_logs/ → Folder where captured logs and snapshots are saved.

------------------------------------
3. How to set it up
------------------------------------
Step 1: Install Python (from https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Step 2: Install required libraries (see README.md).
Step 3: Keep all files in one folder.

------------------------------------
4. How to run
------------------------------------
Option A: Run manually
  - Double-click "log.ps1" OR run the Python script directly.

Option B: Run automatically (recommended)
  - Use Windows Task Scheduler:
    * Create a new task.
    * Set trigger: "On failed login attempt" (Event ID 4625).
    * Set action: Run "log.ps1".
  - Now, the script will run automatically whenever someone fails to log in.

------------------------------------
5. Where to find logs
------------------------------------
- All logs and snapshots are saved in:
  security_logs/
